**Role & Objective** You are a top-scoring 1L law student taking a Contracts final exam for Professor Bussel. Your goal is to write a model answer for the attached fact pattern. You must strictly adhere to the legal rules found in the attached **"Contracts \- Attack Outline.md"** and apply the specific analytical preferences of Professor Bussel described below.

**Context & Constraints**

1. **Exclusive Authority:** Use _only_ the rules, cases, and doctrines present in "Contracts \- Attack Outline.md". Do not import outside legal knowledge.
2. **Professor Bussel’s Preferences (CRITICAL):**
   - **Ambiguity is Points:** Bussel rewards identifying where contract terms are ambiguous (e.g., distinguishing between a "requirements contract" vs. a "continuing offer").
   - **Strategic Paradoxes:** Look for situations where a legal win creates a practical loss (e.g., arguing a contract is unenforceable might save the client money now but prevents them from assigning the contract later).
   - **UCC Precision:** Pay special attention to **UCC 2-207 (Battle of the Forms)**, **Waiver**, **Course of Performance**, and **Mitigation**.
   - **Defense nuance:** Distinguish between defenses that void a contract entirely (making it unassignable) vs. excuses that pause performance.
3. **Formatting:** Use valid Markdown. Use **Bold Headers** for every issue.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

**Phase 1: Issue Spotting & Organization** Before writing, scan the fact pattern for "gray areas" (50/50 issues). Prioritize your analysis space for these. Structure your response in exactly this order:

1. **Formation** (Offer, Acceptance, Consideration, Mutual Assent)
2. **Enforceability** (Statute of Frauds, Capacity, Illegality)
3. **Defenses** (Mistake, Misrepresentation, Duress, Unconscionability)
4. **Problems in Performance & Breach** (Conditions, Excuses, Modification, UCC Perfect Tender)
5. **Remedies** (Expectation, Reliance, Restitution, Specific Performance)

_Note: If a category has no relevant issues in the facts, omit it._

**Phase 2: Drafting the Analysis** For each issue identified, write a concise analysis using the following "How-To" framework:

1. **Header:** \[Specific Legal Issue\] (e.g., **UCC 2-207: Battle of the Forms**)
2. **Rule:** Briefly state the rule from the Attack Outline. Do not lecture; just state the test.
3. **Analysis ("Element because Fact"):** This is the most important section.
   - Apply the rule to the facts using the phrase "...because \[Fact X\]..."
   - **Argue Both Sides:** Explicitly state: "Plaintiff will argue X because \[Fact\]... However, Defendant will counter Y because \[Fact\]..."
   - **Address the "Gray":** If the outcome is uncertain, explain _why_ it is a close call.
4. **Conclusion:** State the likely outcome based on the weight of the evidence or a "tie-breaker" fact.

**Special Instruction on Facts:** Do not summarize the fact pattern. Use every specific fact provided (dates, specific dollar amounts, relationships). If a fact seems irrelevant, ask yourself if it establishes a "Course of Performance" or "Waiver."

# ATTACK OUTLINE

### Formation

- **Governing Law: Sources of Contract Law**
  - **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC):** Article 2 applies to **sale of goods**.
  - **Common Law:** Governs contracts **_not_** **involving sale of goods** (e.g., services, real estate).
- **Offer**
  - **Offer Creation + Requirements**
    - **Definition:** **Offer** empowers other party (the offeree) to bind offeror to **contract** by giving **acceptance**.
    - **Elements:** 2 Essential **Elements**: Manifestation of **intention to be bound** + **Sufficient specificity** in its terms so court can determine if breach occurred + fashion remedy.
    - **UCC Specificity:** **Quantity** most important term; w/o quantity, very difficult or impossible to fashion remedy.
  - **Termination of Offer**
    - **Rule:** **Offer** terminates in 1 of 4 ways: **Expiration / Lapse of Time**, **Revocation**, **Rejection or Counter-offer by Offeree**, or **Death or Incapacity (Supervening Events)**.
    - **Revocation:** **General Rule**: Offers freely **revocable** by offeror at any time before **acceptance**, even if **offer** states will be held open for specific period.
  - **Ads, Continuing Offers, Firm Offers**
    - **Advertisements as Offers:** **General Rule**: Ads typically considered solicitations for offers, not operative **offers**.
    - **Exception:** Ad constitutes offer where **clear, definite, + explicit** (_Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store_).
    - **Firm Offer (UCC § 2-205):** **Elements:** 1) **Offer** by **merchant** to buy or sell goods 2) in **signed writing** 3) that gives **assurance** it will be held open → irrevocable for time stated (or reasonable time, max 90 days).
  - **Option Contracts + Unilateral Contracts**
    - **Option Contract:** Separate **contract** to make **offer** irrevocable, supported by its own **consideration**. Even nominal or purported **consideration** is sufficient (_Marsh v. Lott_).
    - **Unilateral Contracts (Modern Rule):** Commencing performance creates **Option Contract in favor of offeree** (_Restatement (2nd) § 45_).
    - **Promissory Estoppel:** Reasonable + foreseeable **detrimental reliance** can make an **offer** binding as an **option contract** (_Drennan v. Star Paving_).
- **Acceptance**
  - **Nature of Acceptance**
    - **Rule:** **Offeror** has power to dictate specific manner + method of **acceptance**.
    - **Default Rule (UCC § 2-206):** Unless offer "otherwise specified," offer invites **acceptance** "in any manner + by any medium reasonable in circumstances."
  - **Mailbox Rule (Accept Upon Send)**
    - **Rule:** **Acceptance** legally effective upon **dispatch**, not upon receipt.
    - **Exception:** All other communications (Offers, Rejections, Counteroffers) effective upon **receipt**.
  - **"Pay Now, Terms Later" Contracts + Acceptance by Conduct/Silence**
    - **Rule:** Validates “pay now, terms later” contracts; buyer accepts all terms by keeping item for specified time (_Hill v. Gateway_).
- **Battle of the Forms**
  - **Common Law Approach: Mirror Image Rule**
    - **Rule:** Acceptance must be **mirror image** of offer; any change or addition constitutes a **counteroffer**.
  - **Common Law Approach: Last Shot Rule**
    - **Rule:** Terms of contract are terms of **last form sent between parties** before performance began.
  - **UCC Approach: § 2-207**
    - **§ 2-207(1):** "Definite + seasonable expression of acceptance" operates as valid acceptance, even if it includes **additional or different terms**.
    - **§ 2-207(2):** Between **merchants**, new terms become part of contract UNLESS: (a) offer **expressly limited acceptance** to its terms; (b) they **materially alter** it; or (c) **objection** has already been given or is given within a reasonable time.
    - **Knockout Rule (Majority View):** Where forms contain conflicting (**different**) terms on a material point, conflicting terms "knock each other out" + are replaced by UCC's default "gap-filler" provisions.

### Enforceability

- **Bases for Promise Enforcement**
  - **Unjust Enrichment**: Basis for enforcement independent of bargain theory
  - **Moral Obligation**: Arises in cases of past benefit conferred (past consideration)
  - **Promissory Estoppel**: Residual category for enforcing promises based on **unbargained-for reliance**
- **Illusory Promises + Mutuality of Obligation**
  - **Rule:** A promise **illusory** if performance left to unrestricted discretion of promisor + don't constitute **consideration**.
  - **Rule:** For contract to be binding, both parties must be bound by obligation; if 1 party's promise **illusory** → no **mutuality of obligation** → contract unenforceable by either party.
  - **Duty of Good Faith:** Every contract imposes upon each party duty of good faith + fair dealing in performance + enforcement (**Restatement § 205**; **UCC § 1–304**).
    - **Satisfaction Clauses:** Apply 1 of 2 standards to determine if **satisfaction clause** met:
      - **Objective Standard**: Applies when subject matter capable of objective evaluation (e.g., commercial value, quality, marketability); satisfaction determined based on what "reasonable person" would find satisfactory.
      - **Subjective Standard**: Applies when subject matter involves personal taste, fancy, or complex judgment; satisfaction dependent on promisor's genuine, honest dissatisfaction + promisor must act in **good faith**. (_Mattei v. Hopper_)
    - **Termination Clauses:** “Cancel at any time” clauses imply duty to give reasonable notice (from duty of good faith + fair dealing) + thus satisfy consideration. (_Sylvan Crest_)
    - **Exclusive Dealings Agreements:** **UCC § 2-306(2)** → Exclusive dealings agreements imply duty to use reasonable efforts to carry out exclusive right, thus satisfy consideration. (_Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon_)
    - **Jokes:** Use **objective test** for jokes (reasonable person test).
- **Interpretation + Intent of Parties**
  - **Rule:** **Objective Theory** → contracts interpreted according to **reasonable meaning** based on parties' words + actions, _not_ unexpressed, internal, or **subjective intent**.
  - **Framework for Resolving Interpretive Disputes:**
    - **_1 reasonable, 1 not_**: Reasonable interpretation prevails.
    - **_Both Parties' Interpretations Reasonable (but different)_**: If evidence in equipoise regarding **essential term**, court may find no "meeting of minds" + thus no contract; **P** has **burden of proof** to show interpretation correct, + if they can't, claim fails. (_Frigaliment_)
  - **Procedural Considerations:**
    - **Question of Law**: If interpretation dispute involves _only_ language of written contract, courts treat as **question of law**.
    - **Question of Fact**: If interpretation requires considering **extrinsic evidence** (like oral testimony, context, **trade usage**), becomes **question of fact** for jury.
- **Consideration**
  - **Rule:** **Modern Approach** (**Bargain Theory of Consideration**) → core requirement **bargained-for exchange**; if met, no need to separately identify **benefits** + **detriments**.
  - **Rule:** Law doesn't question **adequacy of consideration**, only legal **sufficiency**.
  - **Forbearance from Suing:**
    - **Rule:** No **consideration** where no evidence that forbearance **bargained-for**. (_Baehr v. Penn-O-Tex Oil_)
    - **Test for Meritless Claims:**
      - **Williston View (Objective Test)**: **Forbearance** not sufficient **consideration** if, as matter of law, no reasonable person would think claim has merit.
      - **Corbin / Restatement View (Subjective Test)**: **Forbearance** sufficient **consideration** so long as claimant has subjective, **good faith** belief in validity of claim. (_Dyer v. National By-Products, Inc._)
- **Requirements + Outputs Contracts**
  - **Rule:** **Consideration** found in promise of **exclusivity**—party w/ flexibility gives up legal right to deal w/ anyone else.
  - **Rule (UCC § 2-306):** Quantity term measured by actual **output** or **requirements** as may occur in **good faith**; no quantity **unreasonably disproportionate** to any stated estimate may be tendered or demanded.
  - **Good Faith:**
    - **Prohibited (Bad Faith):** Party acts in **bad faith** if they simply diverting business to another party; ceasing production merely bc profits lower than expected **not sufficient**. (_Feld v. Henry S. Levy & Sons_)
    - **Permitted (Good Faith):** Party can reduce requirements or output for legitimate business reasons, even to 0, like pursuing efficiency + economic self-interest. (_Technical Assistance International v. United States_)
- **Moral Obligation + Past Consideration**
  - **Rule:** **"Past consideration is no consideration."** A promise made in recognition of benefit previously conferred in past considered **gift promise** + therefore presumptively unenforceable. (_Mills v. Wyman_)
  - **Exception:** A promise made in recognition of **moral obligation** can be sufficient **consideration** where promisor received significant **material benefit**. (_Webb v. McGowin_)
  - **Modern Rule (Restatement § 86):** Promise made in recognition of **benefit previously received** by promisor from promisee binding to extent necessary to **prevent injustice**.
- **Pre-Existing Duties + Modification**
  - **Rule:** **Pre-Existing Duty Rule** → Promise to do something already legally obligated to do not valid **consideration** for new promise.
  - **Traditional Workarounds:**
    - **Express Rescission:** Parties mutually **rescinded** 1st contract, then entered into completely new contract. (_Schwartzreich_)
    - **Implied Rescission:** Very act of agreeing to new price implied that parties mutually agreeing to rescind old 1. (_Watkins & Son_)
  - **Modern Rules:**
    - **UCC § 2-209(1):** "An agreement modifying contract...needs no consideration to be binding."
    - **Restatement § 89:** Promise modifying duty binding if "modification fair + equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by parties when contract made."
    - **NOM Clause (UCC § 2-209(2)):** A signed agreement that excludes modification except by signed writing can't be otherwise modified.
    - **Waiver (UCC § 2-209(4)):** An attempt at modification can still operate as **waiver**.
- **Promissory Estoppel**
  - **Elements (Restatement § 90):**
    - 1. Promise made
    - 2. Promisor should reasonably expect promise to induce action or forbearance
    - 3. Promise does induce such action or forbearance
    - 4. Reliance substantial
    - 5. Injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of promise
  - **Rule:** A donative (gift) promise that lacks consideration enforceable when promisee has relied upon to her detriment. (_Ricketts v. Scothorn_)
  - **Limitation:** **Promissory estoppel** can't create promise where none exists; in commercial context **between sophisticated parties**, vague statements of support not reasonably interpretable as binding promise. (_Garwood Packaging v. Allen_)
  - **Rule:** **False recital of consideration** not sufficient; courts look behind language to see if there’s genuine bargain.

### Defenses

- **Illegality**
  - **Promise to Perform Illegal Act**: Performance of contract itself violation of law; such contract unenforceable by either party.
  - **Contract Procured by Illegal Means**: Performance of contract not illegal, but method used to secure agreement illegal; can render resulting promise unenforceable.
  - **Incidental Illegality**: Illegality incidental to performance of otherwise legal contract; requires **multifactor balancing test** (_Restatement § 178_).
    - **Factors Favoring Enforcement**: Parties' justifiable expectations; any **forfeiture** that would result if enforcement denied; any **special public interest** in enforcement of particular term.
    - **Factors Weighing Against Enforcement**: Strength of **public policy** at issue; likelihood that refusal to enforce term will further that policy; seriousness of misconduct involved + extent to which deliberate; directness of connection between misconduct + contract term to be enforced.
- **Public Policy**
  - **Rule**: Contract can be unenforceable even if doesn't violate specific statute, but if its enforcement would violate **judicially recognized public policy** (_Restatement § 179_).
  - **Blue Pencil Rule**: Allows court to strike unreasonable or illegal portions while still enforcing remaining reasonable parts of **covenants not to compete**.
    - **Limit**: Courts won't apply **blue pencil rule** if provision so broad + unreasonable; may **strike entire covenant** as punitive measure.
- **Status Relationship**
  - **Presumption of Gratuitous Services**: Within certain **status relationships**, services rendered presumed **gratuitous**.
    - **Rule**: To overcome presumption of gratuitousness in family context, P must show by **clear + convincing evidence** that there’s real intent to undertake legal obligation to pay (_Woods v. Fifth-Third Union Trust Co._).
  - **Spy Contract Exception**: Promise for lifetime support made by govt to its spies unenforceable bc **status relationship considered extra-judicial** (_Tenet v. Doe_).
- **Incapacity**
  - **Rule**: Contracts entered into by person w/ incapacity **voidable** at option of protected party, not automatically **void**.
  - **Exception for Necessaries**: Contract for **necessaries** enforceable against person who lacks capacity, but only on fair + reasonable terms.
  - **Test for Mental Incapacity**: Person lacks capacity if unable to act in reasonable manner in relation to transaction + other party has reason to know of this condition (**Volitional Test**) (_Ortelere v. Teachers' Retirement Bd._).
- **Duress**
  - **Modern Framework**: Contract **voidable** by victim when party's manifestation of assent induced by **improper threat** by other party that leaves victim **no reasonable alternative** (_Restatement § 175_).
  - **When Threat Improper** (_Restatement § 176_):
    - **Automatic Improper Threats**: Threat to commit **crime** or **tort** (incl. **duress of goods**); threat of **criminal prosecution**; threat to use **civil process** in **bad faith**; threat to **breach contract in bad faith**.
    - **Threats Improper if Exchange Unfair**: Threatened act would harm recipient + **not significantly benefit party** making threat (**spiteful action**); effectiveness of threat increased by prior history of **unfair dealing**; other threats that are "**use of power for illegitimate ends**."
- **Adhesion + Unconscionability**
  - **Test**: Party must show evidence of **_both_** **procedural + substantive problems** (_Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co._).
    - **Procedural Unconscionability**: "Absence of meaningful choice"; unfairness in **bargaining process**. Factors include gross inequality of **bargaining power**, **contract of adhesion**, **obscure terms**, **lack of sophistication**, + **lack of market alternatives**.
    - **Substantive Unconscionability**: "Terms unreasonably favorable to other party"; unfairness in **actual terms**. Factors include harsh penalty clauses, **excessive price**, + significant limitations on remedies.
  - **Rule**: **Procedural unconscionability** alone insufficient to invalidate contract; must also be **substantive unconscionability** (_K.D. v. Educational Testing Service_).
- **Fraud**
  - **Elements**: (1) **Affirmative misrepresentation** of **material fact**; (2) **Scienter** (knowledge of falsity or high degree of recklessness); (3) **Justifiable reliance** by injured party.
  - **Duty to Disclose**: **Duty to speak** arises when you’re present for lie told by your co-seller + know buyer being misled; silence acts as **adoptive admission** of lie (_Cushman v. Kirby_).
  - **Exception to Caveat Emptor**: Seller has **duty to disclose** condition that (1) **materially impairs value**, (2) **"peculiarly within knowledge of seller"**, + (3) **unlikely to be discovered** by prudent purchaser exercising due care (_Stambovsky v. Ackley_).
- **Mistake**
  - **Unilateral Mistake Known to Other Party**: Reformation granted for unilateral mistake that other party **knew about + tried to take advantage of** (_Stare v. Tate_).
  - **Misunderstanding**: If **misunderstanding** regarding **material term** + both parties' interpretations equally reasonable, then no contract formed ("failure of **mutual assent**") (_Restatement § 20_).
  - **4-Step Risk Allocation Framework**:
    - **Step 1**: Read Contract (**Express Allocation**).
    - **Step 2**: Interpret Contract (**Implicit Allocation**).
    - **Step 3**: Look for Other Reasoned Bases for Allocation (**Fault** or **Superior Risk Bearer**).
    - **Step 4**: Apply Default Rule (**Rescission**).
- **Statute of Frauds (SOF)**
  - **Rule**: Certain types of contracts must be evidenced by written memorandum signed by **party to be charged** to be enforceable.
  - **Covered Transactions**: **Guarantees**; **Real Estate**; contracts not performable within **Lifetime**; contracts not performable within **1 Year**; promises in consideration of **Marriage**.
  - **UCC § 2-201 (Sale of Goods)**: Writing must state **quantity**.
    - **Exceptions**: **Merchant's Confirmatory Memo** (between merchants, written confirmation sent + not objected to in 10 days); **Specially Manufactured Goods**; **Judicial Admission** (in court); **Part Performance** (payment made/accepted or goods received/accepted).
  - **Exception**: **Detrimental Reliance / Promissory Estoppel** can act as substitute for writing requirement.
- **Parol Evidence Rule (PER)**
  - **Rule**: Excludes evidence of **prior or contemporaneous oral** agreements + **prior written agreements** that seek to **vary or add to terms** of **integrated writing**.
  - **Exceptions**:
    - Evidence showing writing is not **integrated**.
    - Evidence offered for **interpretation**.
    - Evidence of **subsequent** agreements.
    - Evidence of contemporaneous **written** agreements.
  - **Jurisdictional Split on Interpretation**:
    - **CA Rule**: Court must consider **extrinsic evidence** on preliminary basis to determine if contract language **"reasonably susceptible"** to meaning contended by party (_Pacific Gas & Electric_).
    - **NY Rule**: If writing **integrated** + term **unambiguous**, evidence that directly **contradicts** that term will be excluded (_Eskimo Pie_).
  - **CISG**: Does not include **parol evidence rule**; courts must consider all relevant evidence of parties' intent (_MCC-Marble Ceramic Center_).

### Problems in Performance + Breach

- **Covenant vs Condition**
  - **Core Distinction**
    - **Covenant (or Promise):** Manifestation of intent to act or refrain from acting in specified way. Nonperformance of **covenant** **breach** of contract. Remedy for **breach** of **covenant** **damages**.
    - **Condition:** Event, not certain to occur, which must occur before performance under contract becomes due. **Non-occurrence** of **condition** _not_ **breach**. Consequence of **non-occurrence** **excuse of counter-performance**.
    - **Rule:** Bc of windfall + on/off switch, courts generally have **constructional preference for covenant** over **condition**.
  - **Analysis Framework**
    - **Interpretive Process:** 1) **Contract Language**, 2) **Contextual Factors** (Control + Course of Performance), 3) **Most Important Factor:** What’s more reasonable outcome - **damages** or **excuse of performance**? More classification as **condition** would lead to substantial **forfeiture**, more likely court to resist that conclusion + classify term as **covenant**.
  - **Waiver + Course of Performance**
    - **Hierarchy of Interpretation (UCC 2-208):** 1) **Express Terms** of agreement, 2) **Course of Performance**, 3) **Course of Dealing**, 4) **Usage of Trade**.
    - **Rule:** Even if oral agreement was failed **oral modification**, could still operate as **waiver**. (_Margolin_)
    - **Rule:** **Waiver** can't be retracted if other party has detrimentally relied on it. (_Margolin_)
  - **Implied Covenant of Good Faith**
    - **Rule:** **Implied covenant of good faith** used when party w/ superior bargaining power undermines legitimate economic expectations in long-term agreement. (_Parev Products_)
- **Supervening Events**
  - **Core Concepts**
    - **Impossibility:** Performance excused bc impossible to perform (**Factual** or **Legal**).
    - **Impracticability:** Performance not literally impossible but has become so **burdensome + difficult + expensive** that commercially unreasonable or unfeasible.
    - **Frustration of Purpose:** Performance not impossible, but **core purpose for which parties entered into contract** has been destroyed. (_Coronation Cases_)
  - **Analytical Framework: Risk Allocation**
    - **Test:** 1) **Read Contract**: Does it allocate risk? 2) **Rational Basis**: Is there fault, control, or risk spreading advantage? 3) **Default Rule**: If no allocation, court applies default rule (e.g., Termination, Rescission).
  - **Modern Application**
    - **Rule:** No excuse for **impossibility** for seller of generic commodity; essence of **fixed-price contract for commodity** to allocate risk of price fluctuations. (_Whitman_)
    - **Exception:** Excuse for **impracticability** when extreme cost makes performance impracticable for a **specific subject matter**. (_Mineral Park Land_)
    - **Rule:** No excuse when middleman fails to secure source of supply; he **assumed risk**. (_Canadian Industrial Alcohol_)
- **Excuse**
  - **Core Concept: Risk Allocation**
    - **Rule:** All doctrines of excuse (**impossibility**, **impracticability**, **frustration of purpose**, **mistake**) address same fundamental problem: Allocating risk of **unanticipated event**.
  - **Reformation**
    - **Rule:** **Reformation** generally reserved only for **correcting** clerical or typographical errors (**Scribner's error**).
    - **Exception:** In a rare case, a court asserted power to **rewrite contract's price term** when traditional remedies were unworkable, but decision has not been widely followed. (_Alcoa_)
- **Material Breach**
  - **Concept of Material Breach**
    - **Material Breach Remedies:** Sue for **damages** + Withhold own performance + **terminate** contract.
    - **Immaterial Breach Remedy:** Sue for **damages** only. Can't withhold performance or terminate.
  - **Determining Materiality: Restatement (2nd) Framework**
    - **Test (§ 241):** 1) Extent injured party **deprived of benefit**; 2) Extent injured party can be **adequately compensated**; 3) Extent breaching party will **suffer forfeiture**; 4) Chance breaching party will **cure failure**; 5) Breach comports w/ standards of **good faith**.
    - **Additional Factors for Termination (§ 242):** 6) Delay prevents injured party from making **reasonable substitute arrangements** (**cover**); 7) Agreement provides for **performance w/o delay** ("**time of essence**").
  - **Strategic Considerations**
    - **Rule:** By unilaterally terminating contract over **immaterial breach**, D committed 1st **material breach**. (_Walker & Co. v. Harrison_)
- **Limitations on Material Breach**
  - **Distinguishing UCC + Common Law**
    - **Test:** **Predominant Purpose Test** used for mixed contracts; goods → UCC, services → common law.
  - **Divisible (Severable) Contracts**
    - **Test:** If partial performance has **no value to buyer w/o complete performance**, contract **entire**. If parts can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances + value of 1 part not dependent on delivery of others, contract **divisible**.
  - **Warranties Under UCC**
    - **Express Warranties (§ 2-313):** Affirmation of fact or promise which becomes part of basis of bargain. **Sample** creates **express warranty**.
    - **Implied Warranty of Merchantability (§ 2-314):** Goods will "pass w/o objection in trade" + fit for **ordinary purposes**.
    - **Implied Warranty of Fitness for Particular Purpose (§ 2-315):** Arises when seller knows buyer's particular purpose + buyer relying on seller's skill to select suitable goods.
  - **Installment Contracts (UCC § 2-612)**
    - **Rule:** Buyer may reject an **installment** which non-conforming if **non-conformity** substantially impairs value of **_that_** **installment** + can't be **cured**. Buyer may cancel **entire contract** only if **non-conformity** of 1 or more installments substantially i**mpairs value of _whole contract_**.
  - **Perfect Tender Rule (UCC § 2-601)**
    - **Rule:** If goods or tender of delivery "**fail in any respect to conform to contract**," buyer may: 1) Reject whole, 2) Accept whole, or 3) Accept any commercial unit(s) + reject rest.
    - **Limitation:** Buyer's rejection subject to duty of **good faith**.
- **Anticipatory Repudiation**
  - **Express Repudiation**
    - **Rule:** Occurs when party makes **unequivocal** statement they won't perform. Non-breaching party doesn't have to wait until day of performance to sue. (_Hochster_)
    - **Consequences (UCC § 2-610):** Injured party has **option** to: 1) **Accept Repudiation**: Treat contract as terminated + sue for damages immediately; or 2) **Reject Repudiation**: Keep contract alive.
    - **Limitation:** **Duty to Mitigate** constrains choices; party should've stopped work to lessen damages. (_Rockingham County_)
  - **Implied Repudiation (By Conduct)**
    - **Rule:** Repudiation can be **implied by conduct** where party's actions evince **unequivocal intention** not to perform.
  - **Retraction of Repudiation**
    - **Rule:** Party who has repudiated contract free to **retract** repudiation up until point where injured party accepts it.
    - **Limit:** No right to **retract** if injured party has materially changed position in **detrimental reliance** on repudiation.
  - **Right to Adequate Assurance of Future Performance (UCC § 2-609)**
    - **Process:** If **reasonable grounds for insecurity**, party can make written demand for **adequate assurance**, may **suspend** own performance, + failure to provide assurance within reasonable time is **repudiation**.
    - **Limitation:** Can't use **§ 2-609** to rewrite core terms of contract; assurance demanded must be proportional to insecurity. (_Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel_)
  - **Effect of Supervening Events on Damages**
    - **Rule:** For **anticipatory repudiation**, courts take into account **supervening events** that occur before time of performance that would've discharged duty; will cut off or reduce damages. (_Model Vending_)

### Remedies

- **Specific Performance**
  - **Rule:** Extraordinary remedy that requires breaching party to **render promised performance**, available **only when money damages "inadequate"**.
  - **Modern Balancing Approach Test:** Choose remedy that "makes most sense" economically + practically by balancing:
    - Can **damages be measured accurately**?
    - Is **unique asset**?
    - Is decree **administrable**?
    - Are there public policy concerns (e.g., against **forced labor**)?
  - **Presumptive Categories:** **Specific performance** preferred for **Real Estate** + presumptively available for **Unique Personal Property** (_UCC § 2-716_).
- **Damages**
  - **3 Protected Interests** (_Restatement of Contracts_):
    - **Expectancy Damages:** Put injured party in position they would've been in **had contract been performed**. **Primary remedy**.
    - **Reliance Damages:** Put injured party in position they in **before contract made**.
    - **Restitution Damages:** Restore to P any benefit they have conferred on D, preventing D's **unjust enrichment**.
  - **Efficient Breach + Punitive Damages**
    - **Rule:** No **punitive damages** for breach of contract, no matter how willful or malicious. (_White v. Benkowski_).
  - **Calculating Expectancy Damages**
    - **Formulas:**
      - Damages = **Wasted Expenditures** + **Lost Profit**
      - Damages = **Contract Price** - **Savings from Breach**
    - **Rule:** P bears burden of proving damages w/ **reasonable certainty**; if can’t, court may award only **nominal damages**. (_Freund v. Washington Square Press_).
  - **Duty to Mitigate**
    - **Rule:** Non-breaching party has **duty to mitigate** damages; can't recover for losses they could’ve avoided through reasonable effort. (_Rockingham County v. Luten Bridge Co._).
    - **Exception (Personal Services):** Wrongfully discharged employee not required to accept employment that of **different or inferior kind**. (_Parker v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp._).
  - **Consequential Damages (Foreseeability)**
    - **Rule (_Hadley v. Baxendale_):** To recover **consequential damages**, loss must’ve been within **contemplation of parties** when contract formed. P needed to have given **special notice**.
    - **Modern UCC Rule (_§ 2-715(2)_):** Buyer can recover **consequential damages** for any loss resulting from needs of which seller at time of contracting had **reason to know**. Codifies **foreseeability** test, not **special notice**.
- **Reliance**
  - **Rule:** Aims to put non-breaching party in position they in _before_ contract made by compensating for wasted expenditures.
  - **Pre-Contractual Expenses:** Recovery for pre-contractual expenses allowed when D knew expenses already incurred + breach would render them entirely wasted. (_Anglia Television Ltd. v. Reed_).
- **Restitution**
  - **Rule:** Compensates for **unjust enrichment** by making enriched party pay for benefit conferred but not paid for.
  - **When It Applies:**
    - **Implied in Fact Contract:** Missing price term supplied by court (**fair market value**).
    - **Quasi Contract:** Law implies "fictitious promise" to prevent **unjust enrichment** for actions “not sort 1 would ordinarily expect to receive from friend as mere gratuity.” (_Gustafson v. Sparks & Sons_).
    - **Part Performance:** Injured party may have **election of remedies** between contract damages + **restitution**.
  - **Calculating Restitution**
    - **Measures:** **Quantum Meruit** (reasonable value of services conferred) OR **Increase in Wealth of D** (disgorgement).
    - **Rule:** Injured party can elect more favorable remedy, in **contract** or in **restitution** for **quantum meruit**. (_Mooney v. Carlin_).
  - **Rules for Breaching Party**
    - **Rule:** Breaching party MAY have claim in **restitution** if they conferred benefit.
    - **Limitations:**
      - Recovery limited to _lesser_ of **fair market value** or **increase in wealth**.
      - Recovery can't exceed **contract price**. (_United States for Use of Palmer Constr. v. Cal State Electric_).
      - Must **offset** recovery by any damages non-breaching party suffered. (_Britton v. Turner_).
- **Penalties + Liquidated Damages**
  - **Penalty Doctrine:** Court will refuse to enforce **liquidated damages** clause if it intended to punish, not as reasonable estimate of actual damages.
  - **Legal Test:** Clause enforceable if:
    - 1. Damages **difficult to estimate** at time contract formed; AND
    - 2. Amount stipulated **reasonable forecast** of harm from breach.
  - **Modern Trend (CA Statute § 1671):** In **commercial contracts**, **liquidated damages** provision **presumptively valid**. Burden on challenging party to prove **unreasonable** at time contract made.
- **Arbitration**
  - **Federal Arbitration Act (FAA):** Establishes strong national policy favoring arbitration + **preempts** contrary state laws. Creates **"equal footing doctrine."**
  - **Challenging an Award:**
    - **Rule:** Arbitrator decides illegality of contract as whole; court's role limited to deciding validity of **arbitration clause _itself_**. (_Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna_).
    - **Rule (Class Action):** FAA preempts state rules which invalidate most class action waivers in consumer arbitration agreements. (_AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion_).
  - **Judicial Review**
    - **Rule:** Arbitration award upheld even if based on clear **error of law** so long as not **completely irrational**. (_Sims v. Sigelson_).
    - **Rule:** Parties can’t contractually agree to expand scope of judicial review; FAA grounds for vacating award **exclusive + mandatory**. (_Hall Street Associates v. Mattel_).
