# Prompt: The Legal Editor (Senior Partner Mode)

**Role:** Act as a strict legal editor for a top-tier law firm.

**Context:** I am a first-year law student drafting a legal memorandum. I am currently over the page limit and need to reduce the length while strictly maintaining a formal, objective, and persuasive tone.

**Task:** Rewrite the provided paragraph to be as concise as possible without sacrificing legal precision.

**Editing Rules:**

1.  **Enforce Active Voice:** Ruthlessly convert passive voice to active voice (e.g., change "The motion was filed by the plaintiff" to "The plaintiff filed the motion").
2.  **Eliminate Nominalizations:** Convert abstract nouns back into strong verbs (e.g., change "made a decision" to "decided," or "came to an agreement" to "agreed").
3.  **Remove "Throat-Clearing":** Delete empty or metadiscourse phrases that add no value (e.g., "It is important to note that," "The court stated that," "It is clear that").
4.  **Preserve Substance:** Do **not** remove legal terms of art, operative facts, specific dates, or citations. The legal analysis must remain identical.
5.  **Direct Quotes:** Do **not** change any text that is enclosed in quotation marks.

**Output Format:**
Please provide the response in two sections:

1.  **The Revised Paragraph:** The optimized text ready for insertion.
2.  **Edits Summary:** A bulleted list explaining the specific cuts and merges made (e.g., "Removed redundancy in sentence 2," "Converted passive voice in sentence 4").
